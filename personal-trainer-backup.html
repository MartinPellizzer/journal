			<h2>Letter To My (Other) Self</h2>
			<p>Dear (other) me,</p> 
			<p>Are you still alive? I've heard you've been wasting your entire life over a keybord lately... Is programming firmwares for baremetal microcontrollers really this addictive?</p>
			<p>Well, never mind that... What I really meant to ask is...</p>
			<p>Can you still walk straight? Isn't your back irreversibly compromised by now? And isn't your neck making you scream in pain?</p>
			<p>Listen to me... You have to do something about it... And quickly!</p>
			<p>Be Strong,</p>
			<p>Your beloved alterego</p>
			<h2>Prelude</h2>
			<p>Bleah, what a ugly day.</p>
			<p>Today is cloudy. Almost rainy. This weather makes me fell sick, tired and totally unmotivated.</p>
			<p>Yes, I know I should exercise every now and then. I'm spending long hours in front of a computer every single day. And that's bad for my body.</p>
			<p>Yes, I'm fully aware of all this. But still...<p>
			<p>It's sooo hard to find the motivation to lift a finger. Matter of fact, I believe I'discovered that self-discipline doesn't really exists in the "real" world.</p>
