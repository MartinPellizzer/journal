			Node Editor Pt. 1 - Quick Setup
		</h1>
		<p>
			As I anticipated in the previous part, we are going to use SDL to create our window. So, what is SDL?
		</p>
		<p>
			Long story short, SDL is a library (written in C) that will help us draw "stuff" on the screen. End of the story!
		</p>
		<p>
			Ok ok... fair enough... let me elaborate a little bit more on that.
		</p>
		<p>
			As we want to build a program with a graphical user interface (GUI), and NOT just a simple command-line utility, we have to take care of a lot of things. To name a few: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> we need to create a window</li>
			<li> we need to create a renderer</li>
			<li> we need to get and react to input (mouse and keyboard)</li>
			<li> blah blah blah...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Unfortunatelly, all this stuff takes both time and OS-specific knowledge. That said, we are here to ONLY make a node editor, and NOT to develop a platform-layer API.
		</p>
		<p>
			In conlusion, we will use SDL to easily create a <strong>Window</strong> with a <strong>Renderer</strong>, and we will also use it to easily get <strong>Inputs</strong> from the mouse and the keyboard.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's it! Nothing more.
		</p>
		<p>
			After we get a blank window opened, we will start building our node editor fron scratch in plain C.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Developing Environment
		</h3>
		<p>
			Windows, MacOS, Linux... Pick your poison. 
		</p>
		<p>
Personally, I'm going to use Linux (Ubuntu). 
		</p>
		<h4>
			Linux Setup
		</h4>
		<p>
			If you already have Linux installed on your PC, good!! If not, I suggest you to install it in a virtual machine (search on youtube for "Install Ubuntu On A Virtual Machine", or something like that).
		</p>
		<h4>
			Installing Packages
		</h4>
		<p>
			In order to be able to compile C code, we need to quickly install a couple of packages.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, after you have your Ubuntu up and running, open the terminal and type the following command:
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				sudo apt install build-essential
				sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>
			Nice. Now you have all you need to build a C program. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<h4>
			Writing Our First C Program
		</h4>
			Let's write our first C program. Open a text editor (in my case Vim) and create a file named <i>main.c</i>. Inside <i>main.c</i> type the following:
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				#include &ltstdio.h&gt

				int main()
				{
					printf("first test\n");
					return 0;
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>
			Save the file. And move to the next step.
		<h4>
			Compiling/Running Our First C Program
		</h4>
			To build and run your program, navigate with your terminal to the folder where you created your file, and type on your terminal the following:
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				gcc main.c
				./a.out
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>
			If you are able to see the words <i>first test</i> in your terminal, then conrats.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Adding The SDL Library To Our C Code
		</h4>
		<p>
			The last step for today, is to add the SDL library in our code and init it. That said, open your <i>main.c</i> and add the following code (code added in bold):
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				#include &ltstdio.h&gt
				<strong>#include &ltSDL2/SDL.h&gt</strong>

				int main()
				{
					<strong>SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING)</strong>;
					printf("first test\n");
					return 0;
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
		<h4>
			Linking The SDL Library During Compilation
		</h4>
		<p>
			If you try to compile the program now with <i>gcc main.c</i>, you should get an error. That's because you need to link the SDL library.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is easy to do. Just add the following flag when compiling your code (code added in bold):
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				gcc main.c <strong>-lSDL2</strong>
				./a.out
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>
			If you see no errors, good. If you do, good luck with debugging :)
		</p>
		<p>
			That's all for the setup. Next, we will create the main window.
