	<h2>Letter To My (Other) Self</h2>
	<p>Dear (other) me,</p> 
	<p>Are you still alive? I've heard you've been wasting your entire life over a keybord lately... Is programming firmwares for baremetal microcontrollers really this addictive?</p>
	<p>Well, never mind that... What I really meant to ask is...</p>
	<p>Can you still walk straight? Isn't your back irreversibly compromised by now? And isn't your neck making you scream in pain?</p>
	<p>Listen to me... You have to do something about it... And quickly!</p>
	<p>Be Strong,</p>
	<p>Your beloved alterego</p>
