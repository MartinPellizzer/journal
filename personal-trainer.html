<h1>The Engineering Of An Electronic Personal Trainer</h1>
<p>Dear (other) me,</p>
<p>Are you still alive? I've heard you've been wasting your entire life over a keybord lately... Is programming firmwares for baremetal microcontrollers really this addictive?</p>
<p>Well, never mind that... What I really meant to ask is...</p>
<p>Can you still walk straight? Isn't your back irreversibly compromised by now? And isn't your neck making you scream in pain?</p>
<p>Listen to me... You have to do something about it... And quickly!</p>
<p>Be Strong,</p>
<p>Your beloved Alterego</p>
<h2>Electronic Personal Trainer V0.1</h2>
<p>First things first, I should give this electronic personal trainer a name.</p>
<p>And thy name shall be: Kyactus.</p>
<p>Good. Now that the hard part is done, I should move one by defining some basic functionalities...</p>
<p>;3 Functionalities</p>
<p>For this first version, I'll start super simple. </p>
<p>Kyactus must be able to start "some sort of alarm" every 30 minutes (or so). And I think I'll be using an LED for an easy win (for now).</p>
<p>That's all for now. Fair enough I guess.</p>
<p>;3 Challenges</p>
<p>As this is serius stuff, I must obey to the 7 commandaments:</p>
<p>;* Thy shall be cheap;</p>
<p>;* Thy shall be small;</p>
<p>;* Thy shall be low-power;</p>
<p>;* Thy shall be mass-producible;</p>
<p>;* Thy shall be addicting;</p>
<p>;* Thy shall be modular;</p>
<p>;* Thy shall be baremetal;</p>
<p>;3 Overview</p>
<p>I need 3 things to bring Kyactus to life:</p>
<p>;* Electronic;</p>
<p>;* Software;</p>
<p>;* Enclosure; </p>
<p>For the eletronic part, I'm going to use 3 different services/shops: JLCPCB, LCSC and Aliexpress. Also, I'm going to use a software called EasyEDA to design the PCB.</p>
<p>Then, for the software (yes we need software too), I'm going to use the C Programming Language to program our Kyactus little brain (microcontroller). </p>
<p>Lastly, for the enclosure, I'm going to use a 3D Printer and a free CAD software called FreeCAD.</p>
